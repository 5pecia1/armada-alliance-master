# Static Build



* Download Cardano Node Static build & configuration files
* Extract the file's content
* Check if you already have Cardano Node service running 
  * Safely shutdown your Cardano node if it is running
* Move the new cardano-node and cardano-cli files to where ever you have the old binaries. If you are using the Pi-Node guides they are in your `~/.local/bin`
* Replace the old configuration files if needed in your `~/pi-pool/files/` directory
*
