What we are looking for

_We appreciate all contributions but we do have aspects of the project that take priority._

* Find and fix inconsistencies in guides
* Translating the guides into different languages
* Help explain guides to others from different various backgrounds

Rules and Expectations

_As an open source project we expect a certain standard from you:_

* Be respectful and open minded to others opinions and conversations around this project. Understand that as a community we should all be working together. Take into consideration that the way in which another contributor is helping may be diffrent from your own and that it is more productive to help eachother out rather than argue about which way is "correct".
* ADA.Pi's tutorials are released with a Contributors Code of Conduct. By partaking in this project you agreed to abide to these terms.
* If you open a pull request, please make sure that your contribution passes all tests, as failures will sunder the project and a fix must be made.
* Content that is to be added should be relevent to the project and not include self promotion or the promotion of sponsers. Understand that what is submited here will be considered open source and will be shared freely amongst everyone. 

How to contribute

_First, throughy read through the project and consider what level of contribution yours will be._

* For a minor contribution, such as a grammer, open a pull request.
* For a major contribution, such as a new tutorial, start by ordering an issue first. This way the community can assess and discuss your idea, before you start working on it.

Style Guide

_If you are contributing tutorials or guides please check out our_ Style Guide _so that it blends into the project seemlessly._

Community

Discussions about the Open Source Guides take place on this repository's Issues and Pull Requests sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly. Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.
