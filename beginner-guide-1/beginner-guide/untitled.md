###  Installing the Raspberry Pi Debian "buster" OS <a id="h.lpv6ciisjqp3"></a>

We are going to now download the latest official release of Raspberry Pi 64bit Debian OS. This is the official Linux 64bit OS distribution that is designed for the Raspberry Pi and its arm64 CPU. This makes it stable and very easy to get started with the Raspberry Pi 

1.  **Download the Debian ‚Äúbuster‚Äù Raspberry Pi 64bit OS image right -&gt;** [**here**](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/raspios_arm64-2020-08-24/2020-08-20-raspios-buster-arm64.zip) **and save it in an accessible location for now on your computer.**
2. **Next, download the raspberry pi imager software that we will use in order to install the OS onto our  Raspberry Pi. This software is located on the** [**Raspberry Pi website**](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) **download the correct version for**
