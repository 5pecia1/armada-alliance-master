# Setup a relay node on Testnet

{% hint style="danger" %}
**This tutorial is meant to get a single node syncing to the Cardano blockchain! We have skipped certain steps and security in order to make this tutorial as easy as possible - DO NOT USE this tutorial to form a mainnet stake pool. Please use our** [**intermediate guides**](../../intermediate-guide/pi-pool-tutorial/) **for the mainnet.**    
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
 **This tutorial is for only use with Raspberry Pi OS 64bit and is solely for educational purposes to get a cardano-node syncing to the blockchain.** 
{% endhint %}

## Summary 

1. Environment Setup
2. Downloading the binaries needed to build a Cardano node relay
3. Download configuration files from IOHK/Cardano-node
4. Edit the config settings 
5. Download a db snapshot to speed up the sync process
6. Run the basic passive relay node to connect to the testnet
7. Monitor the relay node with gLiveView

## Setting up our environment

* We must first update our OS and install needed upgrades if available.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is highly recommended to update the operating system every time you boot up and log in to your **Raspberry Pi** to prevent security vulnerabilities.
{% endhint %}

\*\*\*\*

```
# We are using the sudo prefix to run commands as non-root-user  

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

```

* We can now reboot the Pi and let the updates take effect by running this command in a terminal.

```bash
sudo reboot 
```

* Next, we need to continue with a few more tasks to make sure our Pi is ready to build the cardano node. This is going to be similar to what we will do later in the intermediate tutorials, but right now we are going to keep it simple. . We need to make a few directories, 

* [ ] Make the needed directories for our cardano-node.
* [ ] add ~/.local/bin to our $PATH
* [ ] Create our bash variables. 
* [ ] Download the static cardano-node, cardano-cli build  
* [ ] Unzip the files and move them to ~/.local/bin
* [ ] Create systemd file and startup script to safely shutdown and restart our RPi relay

### Make our directories 

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin
mkdir -p $HOME/testnet-relay/files
```

### Add ~/.locaol/bin to our $PATH
{% hint style="info" %}
https://www.howtogeek.com/658904/how-to-add-a-directory-to-your-path-in-linux/
{% endhint %}

```bash
echo PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```
### Create our bash variables
{% hint style="info" %}
https://askubuntu.com/questions/247738/why-is-etc-profile-not-invoked-for-non-login-shells/247769#247769
{% endhint %}

```bash
echo export NODE_HOME=$HOME/testnet-relay >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo export NODE_FILES=$HOME/testnet-relay/files >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo export NODE_CONFIG=testnet >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo export NODE_BUILD_NUM=$(curl https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/iohk-nix/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/index.html | grep -e "build" | sed 's/.*build\/\([0-9]*\)\/download.*/\1/g') >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH="$NODE_HOME/db/socket" >> $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

### Download the static cardano-node, cardano-cli build

* A static build is one in which all dependencies are included in the final build result which allows you to immediately run it on a compatible system without having to deal with building anything.

| Provided By | Link to Cardano Static Build  |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Moritz \[ZW3RK\]](https://zw3rk.com/) | [https://ci.zw3rk.com/build/1753/download/1/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl-cardano-node-1.26.1.zip](https://ci.zw3rk.com/build/1753/download/1/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl-cardano-node-1.26.1.zip) |

* Now we need to simply download the zip file above to our Pi's home directory and then move it to the right location so we can call on it later to start the node.

```bash
# First change to our home directory
cd ~/

# Now we can download the static build 
wget https://ci.zw3rk.com/build/1753/download/1/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl-cardano-node-1.26.1.zip
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are unsure if the file downloaded or need the name of the folder/files, we can use the linux "ls" command to list everything in our current working directory.
{% endhint %}

* Use "unzip" command on the downloaded zip file.

```bash
unzip aarch64-unknown-linux-musl-cardano-node-1.25.1.zip
```

* Next, we need to make sure the newly downloaded "cardano-node" folder and its contents are present.  

```bash
ls
```

* You should see this in your home directory after running ls command:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-03-21-at-7.29.03-pm%20%281%29.png)

* Now we need to move the cardano-node folder into our local binary directory.

```bash
mv cardano-node ~/.local/bin
```

* Stay in the home directory and add a new directory/folder to download the Cardano config files and monitoring service we will be using.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can call the folder whatever you would like, but it is recommend to name it according to its use.
{% endhint %}

```bash
mkdir testnet-relay
cd testnet-relay/
```

* Download the four Cardano node configuration files we need from the official [IOHK website](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/5822084/download/1/index.html) and or [documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/en/latest/stake-pool-operations/getConfigFiles_AND_Connect.html). We will be using our CLI "wget" command to download the files.

```bash
wget https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/testnet-config.json
wget https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/testnet-byron-genesis.json
wget https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/testnet-shelley-genesis.json
wget https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/testnet-topology.json

```

* Use the nano bash editor to change a few things in our "testnet-config.json" file
* [ ] Change the **"TraceBlockFetchDecisions"** line from "**false**" to "**true**"
* [ ] Change the **"hasEKG"** to **12600**
* [ ] Change  the **"hasPrometheus"** address/port to 12700

```bash
sudo nano testnet-config.json
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Due to the size of the blockchain it may take anywhere from 25 to 40 hours to get your node fully synced.
{% endhint %}

## Download a snapshot of the blockchain to speed the sync process

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure you have not started your node before proceeding. Shut it down if so.
{% endhint %}

* Thankfully, we have been provided a "snapshot" of the database folder from the [\[OTG\] Star Forge Stake Pool](https://adamantium.online/). This will dramatically speed up the process.
* We will run the following commands and then begin downloading the snapshot.

```bash
# make sure you are in testnet-relay/ folder
cd testnet-relay
wget -r -np -nH -R "index.html*" -e robots=off https://db.adamantium.online/db/
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This download will take anywhere from 25 min to 2 hours depending on your internet speeds.
{% endhint %}

## Finish syncing to the blockchain 

* Now we can start the "passive" relay node to begin syncing to the blockchain.

```bash
cardano-node run \
   --topology testnet-topology.json \
   --database-path db \
   --socket-path db/socket \
   --host-addr 0.0.0.0 \
   --port 3000 \
   --config testnet-config.json 
```

## Setting up gLiveView to monitor the node during its syncing process

```bash
cd cardano-node/
curl -s -o gLiveView.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/gLiveView.sh
curl -s -o env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/env
chmod 755 gLiveView.sh
```

* Use nano to edit the env file and change the "**CNODE\_PORT**" to the port you set on your cardano-node, in our case let's change it to **3000.**

```bash
sudo nano env
```

* Finally, we can exit the nano editor and just run the gLiveView script.

```bash
cd cardano-node
touch db/clean
./gLiveView.sh
```

If you want to monitor your Raspberry Pi performance you can use the following commands.
