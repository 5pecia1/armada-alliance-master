# How to make a "passive" Relay Node on Testnet

{% hint style="danger" %}
**This tutorial is meant only to get a single node syncing to the Cardano ledger/blockchain! We have skipped certain steps to make this tutorial as easily as possible DO NOT USE this tutorial to form a Stake Pool. Please use our intermediate guides for creation of Stake Pools because we wont be using some resources needed and security measures are almost non-existent in this tutorial.**  
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
 **This tutorial is for only use with raspianOS-64bit and is soley for education purposes for creating a cardano-node and watch it sync to the blockchain** 
{% endhint %}

## _Summary_ 

1. Downloading the Binaries needed to build Cardano node relay
2. Download Configuration files from IOHK/Cardano-node
3. Edit the config settings 
4. Run the basic passive relay node to connect to testnet
5. Monitor Relay Node with gLiveView

## Step 1: Download Files

* **We must first update our OS and install needed upgrades if available**

```
# We are using the sudo preffix to run commands as non-root-user  

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

```

* **We can now reboot the pi and let the updates take effect by running this command in terminal**

```text
sudo reboot 
```

* Now we need to simply download the zip file above to our Pi's Home directory and then move it to the right location so we can call on it later to start the node.

```text
# First change to the home directory
cd ~/

# Now we can download the static build 
wget https://ci.zw3rk.com/build/719/download/1/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl-cardano-node-1.25.1.zip
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are unsure it the file downloaded or need the name of the folder/files we can use the linux "ls" command to list everything in our current working directory 
{% endhint %}

* Use "unzip" command on the downloaded zip file...

```text
unzip aarch64-unknown-linux-musl-cardano-node-1.25.1.zip
```

* Next, we need to make sure the newly downloaded "cardano-node" folder and its contents are present  

```text
ls
```

* You should see this in your home directory after running ls command ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-03-21-at-7.29.03-pm%20%281%29.png)

* Now we need to move the cardano-node folder into our local binary directory 

```text
mv cardano-node ~/.local/bin
```

* Stay in the Home directory and a new directory/folder to download the Cardano config files and our monitoring service we will be using..

{% hint style="success" %}
You can call the folder whatever you would like, but it is recommend to name it according to its use ðŸ˜Ž
{% endhint %}

```text
mkdir testnet-relay
cd testnet-relay/
```

* Download The four Cardano Node Configuration files we need to actually build from the official [IOHK website](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/5822084/download/1/index.html) and or [documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/en/latest/stake-pool-operations/getConfigFiles_AND_Connect.html), we will be using our CLI "wget" command to download the files.

```text
wget https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/testnet-config.json
wget https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/testnet-byron-genesis.json
wget https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/testnet-shelley-genesis.json
wget https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/testnet-topology.json

```

* **Use the nano text editor to change a few things in our "testnet-config.json" file**
* [ ] Change the **"TraceBlockFetchDecisions"** line from "**false**" to "**true**"
* [ ] Change the **"hasEKG"** to **12600**
* [ ] Change  the **"hasPrometheus"** address/port to 12700

```text
sudo nano testnet-config.json
```

* Get tmux installed before we run the node so we can exit it without terminating the process

```bash
sudo apt-get install tmux

# Open new tmux terminal in cardano-node directory
cd cardano-node
tmux
```

[https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/) - if you want to know more about tmux commands...

* Now we can start the "passive" node/relay to begin syncing to the blockchain ðŸ§± â›“ 

```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~/cardano-node $ cardano-node run \
>    --topology testnet-topology.json \
>    --database-path db \
>    --socket-path db/socket \
>    --host-addr 0.0.0.0 \
>    --port 3000 \
>    --config testnet-config.json 
```

## Setting up gLiveView to monitor the node during its syncing process

* First thing we need to do is download the prereq script from guild operators and set a few flags or we can just run it lol and watch it break..
* I usually just put the gLiveView.sh into the cardano-node folder and change env

```bash
cd cardano-node/
curl -s -o gLiveView.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/gLiveView.sh
curl -s -o env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/env
chmod 755 gLiveView.sh
```

* [ ] Use nano to edit the env file and change only "**CNODE\_PORT**" to the port you set on your cardano-node, in our case we change it to **3000.**

```bash
sudo nano env
```

* Finally we can exit the nano editor and just run the gLiveView script 

```bash
cd cardano-node
./gLiveView.sh
```
